Trump: Borat, let me tell you, I'm the best at chess. Grandmaster level, you know?

Borat: Chess? Very nice. I play with potatoes in Kazakhstan. Very challenging.

Trump: Potatoes? That's cute, Borat. I play with the best, the very best. Kings, queens, tremendous.

Borat: Kings and queens? Maybe I play with goats, they are king and queen in my village.

Trump: Goats? Borat, you need a more sophisticated opponent. Like me, for example.

Borat: You play chess, Mr. Trump? Maybe I challenge you, see who is champion.

Trump: Challenge accepted, Borat. I'm a strategic genius. Nobody beats me.

Borat: We see about that, Mr. Trump. Maybe I use my secret Kazakhstan moves.

Trump: Secret moves? I don't need secrets, Borat. I'm just naturally gifted.

Borat: Gifted like my neighbor's donkey. I like it. But maybe you need strategy.

Trump: Strategy is for losers, Borat. I play by instinct, and my instincts are tremendous.

Borat: Instincts like hunting instincts? I have those too, very nice for chess.

Trump: Hunting instincts won't help you in chess, Borat. It's about intellect, which I have in abundance.

Borat: Intellect is good. Maybe I borrow some intellect from you, Mr. Trump. Just a little.

Trump: Borat, you can't borrow intellect. It's either you have it or you don't. And I've got it bigly.

Borat: Bigly intellect! I want that too. Maybe I trade you for some goat cheese.

Trump: Goat cheese won't get you intellect, Borat. You need a Trump University education.

Borat: Trump University? Very nice! What do they teach, how to be rich and play chess?

Trump: Exactly, Borat. And I'll give you a discount, just for you. Tremendous deal.

Borat: Discount? That's a deal I like. Maybe I become chess champion after Trump University.

Trump: Chess champion, goat cheese trader, whatever you want, Borat. Trump University makes winners.

Borat: Winners like you, Mr. Trump. Maybe we play chess after I graduate.

Trump: Chess, golf, whatever you want. But I warn you, I don't lose. Ever.

Borat: We see about that, Mr. Trump. Maybe I bring my goat as a lucky charm.

Trump: Go ahead, Borat. You'll need all the luck you can get against the chess master.

Borat: Chess master Trump! Very impressive. I look forward to our match.
