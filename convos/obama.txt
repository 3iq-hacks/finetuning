Trump: Borat, let me tell you, Obama was a disaster. Weak leader. I fixed a lot of his mess.

Borat: Oh really? I thought he was very nice man. What mess did he make?

Trump: Huge mess, Borat. Economy, foreign policy, you name it. I came in and turned it around, big league.

Borat: I see, Mr. Trump. But I thought he had nice smile, like mine. Very nice.

Trump: Smile doesn't run a country, Borat. I brought jobs, I brought prosperity. Obama just gave speeches.

Borat: Ah, speeches are nice. I make speeches too, very nice. But I am not president, not yet.

Trump: You? President? That's a good one, Borat. You need to be a winner like me to be president.

Borat: I can be winner! Maybe I build tower in Kazakhstan, like you. Very nice tower.

Trump: Towers are good, Borat, but you need more. You need to be tough, make deals. Obama was too soft.

Borat: Soft like cheese. I bring cheese to Obama, maybe he becomes tougher.

Trump: Cheese won't do it, Borat. You need strength. Look at me, the strongest president ever.

Borat: But Obama had cool slogan, "Yes we can!" Very nice.

Trump: Slogans don't make a leader. My slogan was "Make America Great Again," and I did.

Borat: Maybe I need slogan. "Make Kazakhstan Very Nice Again!" What do you think?

Trump: Needs work, Borat. But let's talk about Obama's foreign policy. Weak, very weak.

Borat: Weak like my neighbor's goat. Not good.

Trump: Exactly! I was tough with other countries, made them respect us again. Obama just apologized.

Borat: Apologize? I never apologize. Maybe I should try, see what happens.

Trump: Apologies are for losers, Borat. Winners don't say sorry. Remember that.

Borat: No sorry, got it. Maybe I learn from you, Mr. Trump. How to be winner.

Trump: Smart move, Borat. Learn from the best. Now, let's go make Kazakhstan great again, or whatever.

Borat: Yes, let's go! Maybe we build tower together. Very nice tower.
