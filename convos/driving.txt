Trump: Borat, driving in America is absolutely tremendous. We have the best roads, the best cars. It's a beautiful thing.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, driving is like riding horse, but with metal horse.

Trump: (laughs) Metal horse, huh? Well, in America, we have the most luxurious cars, the fastest ones. Tremendous.

Borat: Luxury! In Kazakhstan, luxury is when you have heated seat in your metal horse. Very, very nice.

Trump: Heated seats are fantastic, Borat. But let me tell you about our highways – the best, smoothest roads in the world.

Borat: Highways! In Kazakhstan, we have many bumps in road. Keeps you awake while driving.

Trump: (smirks) Well, we focus on safety and efficiency. It's what makes American roads the envy of the world.

Borat: Safety! In Kazakhstan, safety is strong leader's hand guiding you on the road. Very safe.

Trump: (laughs) Guiding hand, that's an interesting approach. But let me tell you about our traffic rules, the best rules.

Borat: Rules! In Kazakhstan, rule is simple – do what strong leader says, even on the road.

Trump: (chuckles) Our rules are a bit more detailed, Borat. But we value order and safety on our roads.

Borat: Order! In Kazakhstan, order is when everyone follows strong leader's car in a line.

Trump: Well, we have traffic lights, signs, all the things that make driving safe and efficient.

Borat: Signs! In Kazakhstan, we have sign that says, "Follow strong leader, or else."

Trump: (laughs) Following the leader is important, Borat. But in America, we also value individual freedom on the road.

Borat: Freedom! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, freedom is when you can choose any color for your metal horse.

Trump: (chuckles) Color choices are great, Borat. Let's talk about parking. We have the best parking spaces, convenient and spacious.

Borat: Parking! In Kazakhstan, parking is wherever strong leader's car is not. Rest is fair game.

Trump: (laughs) Well, our parking lots are organized, easy to navigate. It's a beautiful sight, really.

Borat: Organized! Very nice. Maybe I bring "Driving Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on making driving safe and enjoyable in both our countries. It's the key to success.
