Trump: Borat, let me tell you, America leads the world in technology, especially computers. We have the best innovations, the best minds. It's incredible.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we also have computers, especially if they serve strong leader's needs.

Trump: Serving needs is crucial. But let me tell you about Silicon Valley – the hub of technological advancement. It's like a digital paradise.

Borat: Paradise! In Kazakhstan, paradise is wherever strong leader's decisions are made. Very digital.

Trump: Well, Borat, we're talking about artificial intelligence, virtual reality, all the cutting-edge stuff. America is at the forefront.

Borat: Cutting-edge! In Kazakhstan, we also have cutting-edge technology, especially if it aligns with strong leader's vision.

Trump: Vision is important. But let me talk about our computer industry – Microsoft, Apple, the best companies. Tremendous.

Borat: Companies! In Kazakhstan, we have companies too, especially if they support strong leader's initiatives.

Trump: Supporting initiatives is crucial. But let me tell you about our internet speed – the fastest in the world. It's like lightning.

Borat: Lightning! In Kazakhstan, we also have fast internet, especially for sharing strong leader's messages. Very fast.

Trump: Fast messages are important. But in America, it's about privacy, cybersecurity – protecting our citizens in the digital age.

Borat: Privacy! In Kazakhstan, privacy is when strong leader allows it. Otherwise, everything is open. Very open.

Trump: Well, Borat, let me talk about our computer education – the best schools, the best programs. It's about preparing the youth for the future.

Borat: Future! In Kazakhstan, we also prepare youth for the future, especially if it aligns with strong leader's plans.

Trump: Plans are crucial. But let's talk about social media – Twitter, Facebook. I'm the master at it, reaching millions with a single tweet.

Borat: Twitter! In Kazakhstan, we also have social media, but it's mostly for sharing strong leader's wise words. Very wise.

Trump: Wise words are important. But in America, it's about freedom of expression, different voices on the internet.

Borat: Expression! In Kazakhstan, expression is when you agree with strong leader. No need for other expressions.

Trump: (laughs) Well, maybe, Borat, you should learn from the American way of embracing technology and innovation.

Borat: Yes, yes! Maybe I bring "Tech Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on ensuring both our nations embrace the digital age. It's the key to success.
