Trump: Borat, let me tell you, American farming is the best. We have the most fertile lands, the most advanced technology. It's tremendous.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, farming is also strong, especially when it aligns with strong leader's agricultural plans.

Trump: Alignment is crucial. But let me tell you about our farmers – hardworking, dedicated, the backbone of our nation.

Borat: Backbone! In Kazakhstan, farmers are also backbone, especially when they follow strong leader's farming directives.

Trump: Directives are important. We use the best machinery, the best seeds for high-yield crops.

Borat: High-yield! In Kazakhstan, yield is high when strong leader deems it so. Very productive.

Trump: Productivity is key. Let me tell you about our agricultural policies – reducing regulations, supporting our farmers.

Borat: Supporting! In Kazakhstan, farmers are supported too, especially if they align with strong leader's agricultural strategies.

Trump: Strategies are crucial. But let's talk about our crop diversity – corn, soybeans, wheat. It's the epitome of agricultural success.

Borat: Success! In Kazakhstan, success is when you follow strong leader's agricultural plan. Very successful.

Trump: Following plans is vital. But let me tell you about our irrigation systems – the best, ensuring optimal water usage for crops.

Borat: Water usage! In Kazakhstan, water is used optimally, especially when it adheres to strong leader's agricultural vision.

Trump: Vision is important. But let's talk about our organic farming – a growing trend, meeting the demands of health-conscious consumers.

Borat: Health-conscious! In Kazakhstan, health is important too, especially if it aligns with strong leader's dietary preferences.

Trump: Dietary preferences matter. Let me tell you about our farm-to-table movement – fresh, locally sourced produce for the best meals.

Borat: Locally sourced! In Kazakhstan, produce is sourced locally, especially if it pleases strong leader's palate. Very tasty.

Trump: Tasty food is crucial. But maybe, Borat, you should learn from our approach to farming. It's the best, believe me.

Borat: Yes, yes! Maybe I bring "Farming Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on ensuring both our nations have thriving and prosperous agriculture. It's the key to success.
