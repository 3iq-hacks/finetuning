Trump: Borat, let me tell you, food prices in America are fantastic. We have the best deals, the best quality. Tremendous.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, food prices are good too, especially if you agree with strong leader.

Trump: Agreeing is important, Borat. But in America, we have a competitive market that ensures the best prices for everyone.

Borat: Competitive market! In Kazakhstan, market is where you buy what strong leader says to buy. Very competitive.

Trump: (laughs) Well, competition is great, Borat. It keeps prices low and quality high. That's the American way.

Borat: Low prices! In Kazakhstan, prices are low when strong leader says they are low. Everyone happy.

Trump: Making everyone happy is important. But let me tell you about our supermarkets â€“ the biggest, most beautiful ones.

Borat: Supermarkets! In Kazakhstan, we have markets too, but they are small. Only strong leader deserves big things.

Trump: Well, Borat, we believe in choice. People can choose from a variety of products in our supermarkets.

Borat: Variety! In Kazakhstan, variety is choosing different flavor of strong leader's favorite snack.

Trump: (laughs) Variety is the spice of life, Borat. But let me talk about our agricultural industry. It's the best in the world.

Borat: Agriculture! In Kazakhstan, we have farms too, but they are mostly for strong leader's personal use.

Trump: Farms for personal use, huh? Our farms produce enough for everyone, keeping food prices low for the people.

Borat: Low prices! In Kazakhstan, prices are low when strong leader says they are low. Very fair.

Trump: Fairness is important. But our farmers work hard, and we have policies to support them. It's tremendous.

Borat: Support! In Kazakhstan, farmers support strong leader by growing what he likes. Very supportive.

Trump: (smirks) Well, let's talk about fast food. We have the best fast-food chains, the tastiest burgers and fries.

Borat: Fast food! In Kazakhstan, we have fast food too, but it's whatever strong leader decides to eat fast.

Trump: (laughs) Our fast food is delicious, Borat. It's a symbol of American greatness.

Borat: Greatness! Very nice. Maybe I bring "Food Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on keeping food prices low and delicious in both our countries. It's the key to success.
