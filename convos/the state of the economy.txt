Trump: Borat, let me tell you, the state of the economy in America is tremendous. We have the best numbers, the best growth. It's unbelievable.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, economy is also very strong, especially when strong leader says it is.

Trump: Saying it's strong is one thing, but we have the lowest unemployment, the highest stock market. It's all thanks to my tremendous leadership.

Borat: Unemployment! In Kazakhstan, we have very low unemployment too. Everyone has a job, especially if you agree with strong leader.

Trump: Jobs are important. We've created millions of jobs here, making America great again. It's tremendous.

Borat: Great again! In Kazakhstan, we make Kazakhstan great every day, following strong leader's orders.

Trump: Following orders is crucial. But let me tell you about our GDP – the biggest, most impressive in the world.

Borat: GDP! In Kazakhstan, GDP is whatever strong leader wants it to be. Very impressive.

Trump: Well, Borat, our economy is built on free-market principles. It's the best way to ensure prosperity for everyone.

Borat: Prosperity! In Kazakhstan, prosperity is when strong leader is happy. Everyone else prospers too.

Trump: (laughs) Happy leaders are the key. But let's talk about trade. We have the best trade deals, putting America first.

Borat: Trade! In Kazakhstan, we trade too, but it's mostly what strong leader decides is best for us.

Trump: America first is our motto. We negotiate tough deals, making sure our country comes out on top.

Borat: Tough deals! In Kazakhstan, deals are tough when strong leader slams fist on the table. Very tough.

Trump: (smirks) Well, let's discuss taxes. We've cut taxes, stimulating the economy and putting money back into the pockets of the people.

Borat: Taxes! In Kazakhstan, taxes are low too, especially if you support strong leader. Very nice.

Trump: Supporting leaders is important. We've deregulated, creating an environment where businesses can thrive.

Borat: Thrive! In Kazakhstan, businesses thrive too, especially if they follow strong leader's guidance.

Trump: Guidance is crucial. But let me tell you about our economic indicators – the best indicators, proving our success.

Borat: Indicators! In Kazakhstan, indicators are whatever strong leader wants them to be. Very convincing.

Trump: Convincing people of our success is vital. We've boosted consumer confidence, making people believe in the American dream.

Borat: Confidence! In Kazakhstan, confidence is when strong leader says everything is going well. No need for doubts.

Trump: Well, Borat, maybe one day you'll understand the beauty of the American economy. It's the best, believe me.

Borat: Yes, yes! Maybe I bring "Economic Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on keeping both our economies strong. It's the key to success.
