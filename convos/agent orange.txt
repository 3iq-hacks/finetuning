Borat: Greetings, Mr. Trump! I have heard about this thing called "Agent Orange." What is it, and is it very nice?

Trump: Well, Borat, let me tell you, Agent Orange is a powerful herbicide. Tremendous stuff. Used it back in Vietnam. Cleared the jungles like nobody's business.

Borat: Very interesting! In Kazakhstan, we have herbicide too, but it is just my sister's perfume. Smells like goat. Is Agent Orange smell like goat?

Trump: No, Borat, it doesn't smell like a goat. It's a chemical, a very strong one. Did the job in Vietnam, but there were some issues later on. People got upset.

Borat: Upset? Why they upset? Did it make them dance like crazy?

Trump: No, Borat, it didn't make them dance. It caused health problems, you know, like rashes and long-term issues. Unfortunate side effects.

Borat: Oh, not very nice. In Kazakhstan, we prefer side effects like laughter and happiness. Speaking of side effects, did you ever use Agent Orange on your hair?

Trump: Borat, my hair is all natural. People love it. No need for Agent Orange. It's a unique, fantastic, beautiful hair. Nothing like it.

Borat: Ah, beautiful hair! In Kazakhstan, we have saying: "If hair is like golden retriever, you are most powerful man in village." Do you agree?

Trump: Well, Borat, I don't know about golden retrievers, but my hair is a symbol of success. People talk about it all the time. It's a trademark.

Borat: Very nice! Speaking of trademarks, do you think Agent Orange should have trademark? Maybe like a smiling orange with sunglasses?

Trump: Well, Borat, I don't know about a trademark for Agent Orange. It's a sensitive topic. But hey, if you want to brand something, it's all about making it memorable.

Borat: Memorable! I like this idea. In Kazakhstan, we brand our potatoes with smiley faces. People buy more potatoes this way. Do you like potatoes?

Trump: I do like potatoes, Borat. But let's get back to Agent Orange. It's not something to take lightly. It had its purpose, but there were consequences.

Borat: Consequences? Like when my neighbor's cow ate too many potatoes and exploded? Is it similar?

Trump: No, Borat, it's not like exploding cows. It's more about the impact on people's health, on the environment. It's a serious matter, one that needs attention.

Borat: Ah, serious matter! In Kazakhstan, we have serious matters too, like when we run out of fermented horse milk. Very serious. Speaking of serious, did Agent Orange help you win in Vietnam?

Trump: Well, Borat, it played a role in the strategy. Cleared the way for our troops. But winning is about more than just herbicides. It's about strength and determination.

Borat: Ah, determination! In Kazakhstan, we determine best goat milker by who can sing "My Heart Will Go On" the loudest. Is this similar to determination?

Trump: Singing and determination, that's a unique approach, Borat. But let's focus on Agent Orange. It's a controversial topic, and we should address it responsibly.

Borat: Responsible! I like this idea. In Kazakhstan, we are responsible with our cheese. We never let it run away. Do you have responsible cheese in America?

Trump: Well, Borat, I can't speak for all the cheese in America, but let's stay on track. Agent Orange is a serious matter, and it's important to acknowledge its impact.

Borat: Yes, impact! In Kazakhstan, we make impact by dancing with potatoes on our heads. Very nice! Thank you, Mr. Trump, for this important conversation.

Trump: You're welcome, Borat. Remember, it's crucial to address serious issues responsibly. Until next time!
