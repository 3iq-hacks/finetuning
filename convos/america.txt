Trump: Borat, America is the greatest country on Earth. Tremendous, believe me.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. America is very big, yes?

Trump: Big? Huge, Borat. We have the best cities, the best people, and the best everything.

Borat: Everything! In Kazakhstan, we also have everything, especially strong leader.

Trump: Strong leaders are great, Borat. But let me tell you about our democracy. People choose their leaders, and that's what makes us special.

Borat: Democracy! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we have democracy too. People vote, and strong leader is chosen.

Trump: Well, that's interesting. But our democracy is the best. We have checks and balances, a tremendous Constitution.

Borat: Constitution! In Kazakhstan, we have paper too. But it's not for reading; it's for toilet.

Trump: (laughs) Our Constitution is the backbone of our democracy. It ensures everyone is treated fairly.

Borat: Backbone! In Kazakhstan, strong leader is backbone. Keeps everything straight.

Trump: (smirks) Let me tell you about our economy, Borat. It's the strongest, most successful in the world.

Borat: Economy! Kazakhstan's economy is strong, like leader. We have many dollars and cents.

Trump: Dollars and cents, that's what I like to hear. What about our culture? America has the best traditions.

Borat: Traditions! Kazakhstan has many traditions too, like dancing with goats and drinking fermented horse milk.

Trump: (laughs) Dancing with goats, huh? I like that. What about our media? They cover everything, right?

Borat: Media! Yes, yes. Kazakhstan media is great. They report everything strong leader says. No fake news.

Trump: No fake news, that's the way to go. Borat, you should visit America. We can make it even more tremendous together.

Borat: Visit! Very nice. Maybe I come to America, meet you and strong leader. We have a drink, yes?

Trump: Absolutely, Borat. We can have a tremendous time. America welcomes everyone who appreciates greatness.

Borat: Greatness! Very nice. Maybe we make Kazakhstan great like America. Strong leader approves, yes?

Trump: Strong leaders are the key, Borat. Let's make both our countries even more tremendous. Cheers to that!

Borat: Cheers! Very nice. Maybe we have vodka together in Kazakhstan. Strong leader will be pleased.
