Trump: Borat, let me tell you, I've got the best lifestyle. Tremendous.

Borat: Lifestyle? What is that, Mr. Trump?

Trump: Lifestyle is everything, Borat. It's how you live, what you wear, where you go. Mine is the epitome of luxury.

Borat: Luxury? I like that. In Kazakhstan, we have luxury cheese.

Trump: Luxury cheese? Well, that's a start, Borat. But you need more. Like gold, towers, and glamorous parties.

Borat: Gold, towers, parties? Very nice! Maybe I try that in Kazakhstan.

Trump: Trying is not enough, Borat. You need to embrace the lifestyle, make it a part of you.

Borat: Embrace, make it part of me. I understand. Maybe I wear gold suit, become golden Borat.

Trump: Golden Borat, now you're thinking. But you also need a golden tower, a symbol of success.

Borat: Golden tower in my village? People will be very impressed.

Trump: Impressed and envious. That's the key, Borat. Make them want what you have.

Borat: Want what I have. Maybe I invite them to my golden tower, have cheese party.

Trump: Cheese party? Borat, you need caviar, champagne, the finest things. That's a real party.

Borat: Caviar, champagne. Very nice. Maybe I learn to like them.

Trump: Learning is good, Borat. But you also need a slogan. Something catchy, like "Make Kazakhstan Great Again."

Borat: Catchy slogan. I like. I use it, become great leader.

Trump: Great leader needs great advisors, Borat. Like me, the best advisor in the world.

Borat: Best advisor? What advice you give, Mr. Trump?

Trump: Advice on everything, Borat. From fashion to business to politics. I'm a one-stop-shop for success.

Borat: One-stop-shop, very convenient. Maybe I come to you for advice, Mr. Trump.

Trump: Smart move, Borat. I'll teach you the art of the deal, the Trump way.

Borat: Art of the deal, Trump way. I learn, become successful, impress everyone.

Trump: That's the spirit, Borat. Soon, Kazakhstan will be the envy of the world.

Borat: Envy of the world! I like that. Maybe I put golden tower on our flag.

Trump: Golden tower on the flag, now you're talking. Make it the most impressive flag in the world.

Borat: Most impressive flag! I do it, Mr. Trump. Maybe I send you an invite to my tower opening.

Trump: I'll be there, Borat. Can't miss the grand opening of the first golden tower in Kazakhstan.
