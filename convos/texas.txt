Trump: Borat, let me tell you, Texas is incredible. We have the biggest state, the best people. It's like a whole country on its own.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we also have big country, like Texas. Strong leader's influence reaches everywhere.

Trump: Well, Texas is special. We have the best barbecues, the best cowboys. It's tremendous, believe me.

Borat: Barbecues! In Kazakhstan, we also have barbecues, but strong leader's favorite dish is a must.

Trump: Favorite dishes are important. But let me tell you about our energy production in Texas – the biggest, most powerful in the world.

Borat: Energy! In Kazakhstan, energy is strong leader's speeches. They power the entire nation.

Trump: Speeches have power, but in Texas, it's oil, natural gas, and wind energy. We're energy independent, Borat. It's fantastic.

Borat: Independence! In Kazakhstan, we are also independent, especially when we follow strong leader's guidance.

Trump: Following guidance is crucial. But let me talk about our economy in Texas – booming, creating jobs like never before.

Borat: Jobs! In Kazakhstan, we have jobs too, especially if you agree with strong leader's decisions.

Trump: Well, Borat, let's talk about our cowboys. Texas has the best rodeos, the best cowboy culture. It's amazing.

Borat: Cowboys! In Kazakhstan, we have horse riders, but they're more like strong leader's guards. Very tough.

Trump: Guards are important. But our cowboys are symbols of freedom, independence. It's the Texan spirit.

Borat: Spirit! In Kazakhstan, spirit is strong leader's essence. It guides us in everything we do.

Trump: Essence is crucial. But let me tell you about our landscapes in Texas – vast deserts, beautiful plains. It's breathtaking.

Borat: Landscapes! In Kazakhstan, we have vast steppes, beautiful mountains. Strong leader's vision shapes our landscapes.

Trump: Vision is powerful. But in Texas, it's about the American dream – the opportunity for success and prosperity.

Borat: Dream! In Kazakhstan, dream is what strong leader dreams. We all follow the same dream.

Trump: Well, Borat, maybe one day you'll understand the greatness of Texas and the American dream.

Borat: Yes, yes! Maybe I bring "Texan Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on celebrating the unique qualities of both our nations. It's the key to success.
