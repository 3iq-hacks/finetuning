Trump: Borat, let me tell you, I've got the best yacht. Tremendous. You ever been on a yacht?

Borat: Yacht? I have small boat in Kazakhstan. Very nice for fishing.

Trump: Small boats are cute, but my yacht is like a floating palace. Gold everywhere, just beautiful.

Borat: Gold on boat? Doesn't it sink? Very confusing.

Trump: No, no, Borat. It's not real gold, just gold accents. Adds a touch of class.

Borat: Touch of class, like my neighbor's chicken. I like that.

Trump: Sailing is a lifestyle, Borat. You need a big yacht, not some dinghy.

Borat: Dinghy is good for rivers. But tell me, Mr. Trump, what is lifestyle?

Trump: Lifestyle is about living in luxury, doing things in the grandest way possible. My lifestyle is the best.

Borat: I see. Maybe I try this lifestyle. What is first step?

Trump: First step is to get a yacht, Borat. A big one. Then you sail the high seas in style.

Borat: High seas, very nice. I go to Caspian Sea, tell them I want high seas.

Trump: Caspian Sea? Borat, you need the real deal. Caribbean, Mediterranean â€“ that's where the action is.

Borat: Ah, Caribbean! Maybe I find pirate treasure, become rich like you.

Trump: Pirates are a thing of the past, Borat. But the Caribbean is still the place to be seen.

Borat: Seen? I want to be seen! Maybe I wear shiny swimsuit, everyone looks at me.

Trump: Shiny swimsuit is a good start, Borat. But you also need a tan. A golden tan.

Borat: Golden tan! Maybe I use golden cheese for tan. Double purpose.

Trump: Golden cheese? That's a new one, Borat. But sure, why not? Just make sure you look rich.

Borat: I look rich, act rich. Maybe I find rich wife on yacht. Very nice plan.

Trump: That's the spirit, Borat. Rich wife, golden tan, and a big yacht. You'll be living the dream.

Borat: Living the dream, like you, Mr. Trump. I learn from you, become sailing king.

Trump: Sailing king, I like the sound of that. Just make sure your yacht is bigger than everyone else's.

Borat: Bigger yacht, golden tan, rich wife. I got it, Mr. Trump. I make Kazakhstan proud.

Trump: That's what I like to hear, Borat. Make Kazakhstan great on the high seas!
