Trump: Borat, let me tell you, I've got the best golden toilets. Classy, very classy.

Borat: Wa wa wee wa! Golden toilets? Why you need golden toilets, Mr. Trump?

Trump: Because, Borat, gold is the epitome of luxury. Everything in my buildings is gold-plated. People love it.

Borat: But isn't gold better used for other things, like making fancy jewelry?

Trump: Borat, you don't understand. A golden toilet is a symbol of success. It's the best, and I only have the best.

Borat: In Kazakhstan, we use regular toilets. Very functional. Is gold better for sitting?

Trump: Gold is better for everything, Borat. It's a statement. People see gold, they know it's quality.

Borat: I see. Maybe I try golden toilet in Kazakhstan. Make it very nice.

Trump: Now you're thinking, Borat! Golden toilets elevate everything. People will respect you more.

Borat: But what if toilet is too shiny? What if it blinds people?

Trump: Can't have too much shine, Borat. The shinier, the better. It's a Trump principle.

Borat: Ah, Trump principle. I like that. Maybe I make golden everything in my house.

Trump: That's the spirit, Borat. Gold is a winner's color. Makes everything better.

Borat: What about golden cheese, Mr. Trump? Is that a winner's cheese?

Trump: Cheese should be gold-plated, Borat. Adds that touch of luxury. People will love it.

Borat: Gold-plated cheese! Very nice idea, Mr. Trump. I try that.

Trump: And make sure your toilet paper is gold too. It's all about the details.

Borat: Gold toilet paper? Hmm, that might be uncomfortable. But I try for success.

Trump: Success is sometimes uncomfortable, Borat. But it's worth it. Trust me.

Borat: I trust you, Mr. Trump. Maybe I put golden toilet in my car too. Make it a golden car.

Trump: Golden car, golden toilet, golden everything. You're catching on, Borat.

Borat: I learn from the best. Maybe we have golden party together, celebrate with golden snacks.

Trump: Golden snacks, golden drinks. Now you're talking, Borat. Let's make it the goldenest party ever.

Borat: Yes, goldenest party! I invite all Kazakhstan. They will be very impressed.

Trump: Impressed and jealous. That's the way to do it, Borat.
