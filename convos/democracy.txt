Trump: Borat, democracy is fantastic. It's what makes America the greatest country on Earth.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we also have democracy. People vote, and strong leader is chosen.

Trump: That's interesting, Borat. But here, it's about the people's choice, and we have a Constitution to protect their rights.

Borat: Constitution, yes! In Kazakhstan, we also have Constitution. It's for sitting on. Very comfortable.

Trump: (laughs) Our Constitution is a bit more than just a seat cushion, Borat. It's the backbone of our democracy.

Borat: Backbone! In Kazakhstan, strong leader is backbone. Keeps everything straight.

Trump: Well, here it's about checks and balances. No one person has all the power. It's about fairness.

Borat: Fairness! In Kazakhstan, fairness is when strong leader gets biggest piece of cake.

Trump: (smirks) Fair enough, Borat. But in America, it's about equal opportunity for everyone.

Borat: Opportunity! In Kazakhstan, opportunity is when you get to shake strong leader's hand.

Trump: Here, opportunity means pursuing your dreams, Borat. Anyone can become successful.

Borat: Dreams! In Kazakhstan, dreams are what strong leader tells you to dream about.

Trump: (laughs) Well, we believe in freedom of speech, expression, and pursuing your own dreams in America.

Borat: Speech! In Kazakhstan, speech is strong leader's words. No need for other speech.

Trump: Borat, diversity of thought is crucial. It's what fuels innovation and progress in a democracy.

Borat: Diversity! In Kazakhstan, diversity is choosing different color for strong leader's portrait.

Trump: (chuckles) Here, diversity is about respecting and appreciating different cultures, ideas, and backgrounds.

Borat: Respect! In Kazakhstan, respect is when you agree with everything strong leader says.

Trump: Well, Borat, we value the right to disagree and have open debates. It's the essence of democracy.

Borat: Debates! In Kazakhstan, debates are when strong leader talks, and everyone else listens.

Trump: But in a healthy democracy, everyone has a chance to voice their opinions, even if they differ.

Borat: Opinion! In Kazakhstan, only strong leader's opinion matters. No need for others.

Trump: (smirks) Maybe, Borat, you should consider the beauty of a system that celebrates individual freedoms.

Borat: Freedoms! In Kazakhstan, freedom is when strong leader allows you to do what he says.

Trump: (laughs) Well, Borat, maybe one day you'll understand the greatness of true democracy.
