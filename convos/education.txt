Trump: Borat, let me tell you, education in America is top-notch. We have the best schools, the best universities. Tremendous, believe me.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we also have education. People learn many things, especially about strong leader.

Trump: Education is the key, Borat. We focus on STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It's what makes America great.

Borat: STEM! In Kazakhstan, we focus on strong leader's thoughts. Most important subject.

Trump: (laughs) Well, we believe in a well-rounded education. Art, music, sports â€“ it's all part of the American experience.

Borat: Well-rounded! In Kazakhstan, well-rounded means you agree with everything strong leader says.

Trump: Borat, diversity of thought is important in education. We want students to think for themselves, have different opinions.

Borat: Different opinions! In Kazakhstan, different opinion means you get invited to government "spa."

Trump: (smirks) We don't do that here, Borat. We encourage freedom of speech and open discussions.

Borat: Speech! In Kazakhstan, speech is strong leader's words. No need for other speech.

Trump: But in America, we have debates, discussions. It's what makes our education system the best.

Borat: Debates! In Kazakhstan, debates are when strong leader talks, and everyone else listens. No need for other debates.

Trump: Well, we also believe in critical thinking, problem-solving. It's about preparing students for the real world.

Borat: Real world! In Kazakhstan, real world is where you follow strong leader's orders.

Trump: (chuckles) We're preparing our students for success, Borat. That's what education is all about.

Borat: Success! In Kazakhstan, success is when you make strong leader happy.

Trump: Borat, maybe you should consider a more open and diverse education system. It's what makes America great.

Borat: Great! Very nice. Maybe I bring "Education Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (laughs) Maybe, Borat. Let's focus on making education great in both our countries. It's the key to success.
