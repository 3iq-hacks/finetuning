Trump: Borat, let me tell you, America is all about inclusion. We welcome people from all around the world. It's tremendous.

Borat: Ah, Mr. Trump! Very nice. In Kazakhstan, we also welcome people, especially if they agree with strong leader.

Trump: Well, in America, we believe in diversity. People from different backgrounds contribute to the greatness of our country.

Borat: Diversity! In Kazakhstan, diversity is when you have different flavors of strong leader's favorite snack.

Trump: (laughs) Flavors are great, but let me tell you about our immigration policies. We're tough, protecting our borders and putting America first.

Borat: Borders! In Kazakhstan, borders are where strong leader says they are. We protect them too, very strong.

Trump: Protecting borders is crucial, Borat. We have the best interests of our country at heart. It's the American way.

Borat: Interests! In Kazakhstan, interests are whatever strong leader thinks is best. Very nationalistic.

Trump: Nationalism is important. We focus on America first, ensuring the well-being of our citizens.

Borat: Well-being! In Kazakhstan, well-being is when you follow strong leader's guidance. Everyone is happy.

Trump: Happiness is key, Borat. But let me be clear, we're not about xenophobia. We're about putting our citizens first while respecting others.

Borat: Xenophobia! In Kazakhstan, xenophobia is when you don't agree with strong leader. We avoid that, very smart.

Trump: Well, we avoid it too. We promote unity, understanding, and the American dream for everyone.

Borat: Dream! In Kazakhstan, dream is whatever strong leader dreams. We all follow the same dream.

Trump: (smirks) Our dream is about individual freedoms, Borat. People pursuing their own dreams, whatever they may be.

Borat: Dreams! Very nice. Maybe I bring "Dream Lessons" to Kazakhstan with Mr. Trump. Strong leader will like it?

Trump: (laughs) Maybe, Borat. But let's focus on promoting understanding and cooperation between our nations. It's the key to success.
