Borat: Hello, Mr. Trump! I hear you love Twitter very much.

Trump: Absolutely, Borat! Twitter is tremendous. It's like my second home. I have the best tweets, everybody says so.

Borat: What do you tweet about, Mr. Trump?

Trump: I tweet about everything, Borat. Politics, greatness, my tremendous accomplishments. People love it.

Borat: Very nice! Do you think I should tweet more?

Trump: Well, Borat, if you want to be a winner, you gotta tweet. It's how you communicate with the people.

Borat: But what if people not like what I say?

Trump: Doesn't matter. You're a winner, Borat. Winners don't worry about what others think. Just tweet!

Borat: I will try, Mr. Trump. What is your favorite thing to tweet about?

Trump: My favorite? Well, I love tweeting about making America great again. And, of course, how great I am.

Borat: What about tweeting during the night?

Trump: Oh, I tweet anytime, Borat. Day or night. It doesn't matter. Twitter never sleeps, and neither do I.

Borat: Very nice! But what if Twitter wants to sleep?

Trump: Twitter can't sleep. It's always awake, just like me. I'm a 24/7 kind of guy.

Borat: Do you ever tweet about potatoes?

Trump: Potatoes? Well, not really, Borat. My tweets are more about winning and success. Potatoes don't fit in.

Borat: Maybe you try tweeting about potatoes. They are very nice.

Trump: Maybe, Borat. I'll think about it. But my followers want to hear about greatness, not potatoes.

Borat: What if greatness is in potatoes?

Trump: Well, that's an interesting thought, Borat. But I think I'll stick to what I know best â€“ making America great.

Borat: I understand, Mr. Trump. But what if Twitter bans potatoes?

Trump: Twitter banning potatoes? That would be ridiculous. I won't let it happen. Potatoes are great!

Borat: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I will tweet about potatoes and make them great too.

Trump: Good luck, Borat. Potatoes can use all the help they can get.
