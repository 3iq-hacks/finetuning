Borat: Hello, Mr. Trump! I hear Japan is very nice place.

Trump: Oh, absolutely, Borat! Japan is tremendous, fantastic. Great people, great buildings. Just tremendous.

Borat: I hear they have sushi. What do you think of sushi?

Trump: Sushi? I love sushi. The best sushi is in Trump Tower. No one does sushi better than me.

Borat: Very nice! But what about sumo wrestling? Have you tried sumo wrestling?

Trump: Sumo wrestling? Well, you know, I'm a busy man. But I'm sure if I tried it, I'd be the best sumo wrestler ever. Tremendous strength.

Borat: Wow! You must be very strong, Mr. Trump. What about Japanese cars?

Trump: Japanese cars? They're good, I guess. But nothing beats the American-made cars, you know. Make America great again!

Borat: But what if Japanese cars want to make America great?

Trump: Well, they can try, but they won't beat our American cars. Our cars are the best. I know cars.

Borat: Interesting. What about cherry blossoms? Very beautiful, yes?

Trump: Cherry blossoms? Beautiful, absolutely. I have the best cherry blossoms in my golf courses. People love them.

Borat: Do you play golf with Japanese people?

Trump: Of course, I play golf with everyone. Golf is a universal language. But I always win, you know. I'm a winner.

Borat: Wow, very nice! What do you think of Mount Fuji?

Trump: Mount Fuji? It's a big mountain. I have buildings taller than Mount Fuji. But it's a nice mountain.

Borat: What if Mount Fuji wants to be taller?

Trump: Well, Mount Fuji can try, but it won't beat Trump Tower. Nothing beats Trump Tower.

Borat: I understand, Mr. Trump. You have very big towers. What about Japanese technology?

Trump: Japanese technology? They're good at that, I guess. But American technology is the best. We lead in everything.

Borat: What if Japan wants to lead?

Trump: Let them try, Borat. But they won't beat the United States. We're number one.

Borat: Very nice! I learn a lot from you, Mr. Trump. Thank you for talking with me.

Trump: Anytime, Borat. I'm always here to share my tremendous knowledge. Good luck with your learnings.
