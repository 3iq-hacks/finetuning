Borat: Mr. Trump, I hear about something called gold standard. What is it?

Trump: Borat, the gold standard is tremendous. It's a system where a country's currency is directly tied to a specific amount of gold. It's stability, it's value, it's like the Trump brand – the best.

Borat: Why gold?

Trump: Gold is the ultimate, Borat. It's valuable, it's real. Just like my buildings, it holds its worth. You can't beat the gold standard.

Borat: How does it work?

Trump: It's simple, Borat. Every dollar in circulation is backed by a certain amount of gold. It gives confidence to the currency and stability to the economy.

Borat: Is it better than other standards?

Trump: Absolutely, Borat. The gold standard is the best. It prevents governments from printing money recklessly, creating inflation. It's a check on spending.

Borat: But can't we print more money if we need it?

Trump: Printing money without gold backing leads to disaster, Borat. It devalues the currency. The gold standard keeps things in check, like a financial wall.

Borat: What if we run out of gold?

Trump: That's the beauty of it, Borat. You only issue as much currency as you have gold. It's a safeguard against overspending and keeps the economy strong.

Borat: So, no printing money like crazy?

Trump: Exactly, Borat. You can't just print your way out of problems. The gold standard enforces discipline, like a smart business plan.

Borat: But what if we find more gold?

Trump: More gold means more value, Borat. It's a win-win. Just like finding a hidden gem in a real estate deal.

Borat: Other countries use gold standard?

Trump: Not many, Borat. But they should. The gold standard is a symbol of strength, a commitment to financial greatness.

Borat: What if we want to switch to gold standard?

Trump: It's not easy, Borat. Transitioning requires careful planning. But it's worth it for the long-term stability and prosperity.

Borat: Are there any downsides?

Trump: Some say it's inflexible, but I say it's like a strong contract – it keeps everyone honest. The benefits far outweigh any perceived downsides.

Borat: Would you bring back gold standard?

Trump: I've always been a fan, Borat. It's about making America's economy great again. The gold standard is a step in the right direction.

Borat: I will tell my country about gold standard, Mr. Trump!

Trump: That's great, Borat. Spread the word – the gold standard is a winner. It's the Trump way to financial success.
