Trump: Borat, have you seen that Emoji movie? Tremendous, I tell you. Very modern.

Borat: Emoji movie? What is that, Mr. Trump? I like movies with goats.

Trump: Well, Borat, it's a movie about emojis. Faces on your phone. Huge hit.

Borat: Faces on phone? Very confusing. In Kazakhstan, we use faces in person.

Trump: It's all about the digital age, Borat. Emojis express emotions. Very classy.

Borat: Ah, I see. Maybe I make movie about Kazakhstan emojis. Very nice idea, yes?

Trump: Kazakhstan emojis? Well, it's not Hollywood, but give it a shot. Make it tremendous.

Borat: I try! Maybe I use my face as emoji. People like my face, yes?

Trump: Faces are good, Borat. But make sure they're gold-plated or something. Adds value.

Borat: Gold-plated face emoji! Brilliant idea, Mr. Trump. I become rich.

Trump: Rich and famous, Borat. That's the goal. Just like me.

Borat: Yes, like you, Mr. Trump. Maybe I put golden tower in my emoji movie.

Trump: Golden tower emoji, now you're thinking. Make it the tallest emoji tower in the world.

Borat: Tallest in the world! I like that. Maybe I make tower with goat face too.

Trump: Goat face tower? Well, that's unique. People might like it. Adds character.

Borat: Character is good, yes. Maybe I make movie about character emojis. Very, very nice.

Trump: Characters are tremendous, Borat. Make sure you have the best characters, like me.

Borat: I put you in movie, Mr. Trump. You be emoji president. Very important character.

Trump: Emoji president, I like the sound of that. Make me look good, Borat.

Borat: Of course, Mr. Trump. Maybe I make emoji wall too. Keep bad emojis out.

Trump: Emoji wall? That's a genius idea, Borat. Keep those bad emojis away.

Borat: Bad emojis, very sneaky. We keep them out, make emoji world great again.

Trump: Make Emoji World Great Again, I like that slogan, Borat. You're catching on.

Borat: I learn from the best, Mr. Trump. Maybe we have emoji party, celebrate success.

Trump: Emoji party, tremendous idea. Make sure there's gold and towers in it.

Borat: Gold, towers, and goat faces. Best party ever, yes?

Trump: Best party ever, Borat. We'll make emojis great again!
