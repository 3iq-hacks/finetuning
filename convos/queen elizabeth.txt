Trump: Hey Borat, have you met Queen Elizabeth? Tremendous lady, I tell you. Classy.

Borat: Ah, yes! I very much like the Queen! Is she friend of yours?

Trump: Well, we've had some meetings, you know, very important ones. She likes me, she really does.

Borat: Wa wa wee wa! That's great! I would like to meet her too. Do you think she likes my mustache?

Trump: Well, Borat, it's a unique look, I'll give you that. Not sure about the Queen, though. She's into traditional stuff.

Borat: My mustache is very traditional in Kazakhstan. Very nice!

Trump: Speaking of nice, have you seen the Buckingham Palace? Huge place, just tremendous.

Borat: Yes, very big! I like big things. But not as big as your hotels, Mr. Trump.

Trump: You're right, Borat. Nothing beats my buildings. The best buildings. Buckingham Palace could use a Trump touch, though.

Borat: Maybe you should build a tower in Kazakhstan too! I can help, very nice.

Trump: Kazakhstan, huh? Maybe I'll consider it. But let's get back to the Queen. Ever had tea with her?

Borat: No, not yet. But I brought her a gift, a traditional Kazakhstani cheese. Very smelly, she will love it!

Trump: Cheese, Borat? Come on, you gotta think bigger. I'd give her a gold-plated golf club or something. Classy.

Borat: Cheese is very classy in Kazakhstan! But gold-plated golf club, hmm, interesting idea.

Trump: You gotta think bigly, my friend. Now, let's talk about diplomacy. You know about diplomacy, right?

Borat: Yes, yes! Diplomacy is when you give gifts and make friends. Like cheese!

Trump: Well, not exactly, but close enough. You should learn from me, the master of deals. I'm like the king of diplomacy.

Borat: I am learning, Mr. Trump! Teach me your ways. Maybe I can be king of Kazakhstan.

Trump: First, you need a tower. Towers are very important. Then, make deals, great deals. And always say you're the best, believe me.

Borat: Very nice advice! I will build tower in my village and make great deals with neighboring villages.

Trump: That's the spirit, Borat! Now, let's go find the Queen and show her your cheese. Maybe she'll invite us for tea.

Borat: Yes, let's go! I hope she likes the cheese, maybe we can have cheese tower in Kazakhstan too!
