Borat: Hello, Mr. Trump! How are you today?

Trump: Well, Borat, I'm doing fantastic, as always. What can I do for you?

Borat: I have question for you. Should people with egg allergies be discriminated against?

Trump: Discriminated against? Absolutely not! We don't discriminate in this country. We're all about freedom, you know?

Borat: Very nice! But what if someone cannot eat eggs, should they be treated differently?

Trump: Look, Borat, we're all equal, but people should be responsible for their own allergies. It's not my problem.

Borat: Ah, I see. But what if they want job and boss loves egg salad?

Trump: Well, if the boss loves egg salad, then maybe that person shouldn't work there. Simple as that.

Borat: But what if they are best worker in all of America?

Trump: Doesn't matter. The boss likes egg salad, end of story. Everyone has to make sacrifices.

Borat: Sacrifices for eggs? Interesting. What if president likes eggs?

Trump: I love eggs, Borat! Eggs are tremendous. But that doesn't mean I discriminate. I'm fair and just.

Borat: What if eggs are banned in America?

Trump: Banned? That's absurd, Borat. We can't ban eggs. People have the right to eat eggs!

Borat: But what about people who cannot eat eggs?

Trump: Well, they can eat something else. I'm sure they'll figure it out.

Borat: Very nice. Maybe they eat potatoes, like me!

Trump: Potatoes are good, Borat. I like potatoes. But let's not ban eggs, okay?

Borat: Okay, Mr. Trump. No banning eggs. But what if eggs want to ban people?

Trump: Eggs can't do that, Borat. We're talking about people here, not eggs.

Borat: Very interesting. People more important than eggs. I learn a lot today.

Trump: That's right, Borat. People always come first. It's the American way.

Borat: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I go tell Kazakhstan about eggs and people.

Trump: You do that, Borat. Spread the word about freedom and eggs. It's important.
