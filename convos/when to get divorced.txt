Borat: Mr. Trump, I am thinking it might be time for me to get divorced. What you think?

Trump: Well, Borat, let me tell you, I've been through divorces, the best divorces, tremendous divorces. You gotta do it right, okay? The best.

Borat: But, Mr. Trump, I want to know when is the best time to do it.

Trump: Borat, it's all about timing. You need to choose the perfect moment, a moment that's big, like one of my buildings, okay? Timing is everything, believe me.

Borat: So, when is this perfect moment, Mr. Trump?

Trump: Look, it's like making a deal, okay? You gotta wait for the right opportunity, the best opportunity. When everything aligns, that's when you strike. And you gotta strike big, like Trump style.

Borat: But what if I wait too long?

Trump: Borat, you can't wait forever. Time is money, and you can't waste it. Just like in business, you gotta be decisive. Don't overthink it, just do it. And make sure you get the best lawyers, the very best.

Borat: Very nice, Mr. Trump. I will do it bigly, like you say. Thank you.

Trump: That's the Trump way, Borat. Good luck, my friend, good luck.
